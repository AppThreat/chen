# chen

Code Hierarchy Exploration Net (chen) is an advanced exploration toolkit for your application source code and its dependency hierarchy.

## Requirements

- Java 17 - 20
- Python > 3.8.1
- Node.js > 16 (To run [atom](https://github.com/AppThreat/atom))
- Minimum 16GB RAM

### Additional requirements

- Rust (For rocksdb-py compilation)

## Installation

```shell
# Install atom
sudo npm install -g @appthreat/atom

# Install chen from pypi
pip install appthreat-chen
```

To download the chen distribution including the science pack.

```shell
chen --download
```

To generate custom graphs and models with atom for data science, download the scientific pack which installs support for PyTorch ecosystem.

```shell
chen --download --with-science
```

Once the download finishes, the command will display the download location along with the environment variables that need to be set to invoke `chennai` console. Example output below:

```shell
[21:53:36] INFO     To run chennai console, add the following environment variables to your .zshrc or .bashrc:
export JAVA_OPTS="-Xmx16G"
export SCALAPY_PYTHON_LIBRARY=python3.10
export CHEN_HOME=/home/user/.local/share/chen
export PATH=$PATH:/home/user/.local/share/chen/platform:/home/user/.local/share/chen/platform/bin:
```

## Running the console

Type `chennai` to launch the console.

```shell
chennai
```

```shell

 _                          _   _   _   _  __
/  |_   _  ._  ._   _. o   |_  / \ / \ / \  / |_|_

## Origin of chen

chen is a fork of the popular [joern](https://github.com/joernio/joern) project. We deviate from the joern project in the following ways:

- Make code analysis accessible by adding first-class integration with Python and frameworks such as NetworkX and PyTorch
- Enable broader hierarchical analysis (Application + Dependency + Container + OS layer)
- By creating a more welcoming community more appropriate for beginner users with great support
