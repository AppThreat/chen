# Code Hierarchy Exploration Net (chen)

> An advanced exploration toolkit for your application source code and its dependency hierarchy.

The project is under active development. With version 1, we aim to cater to the following use cases:

- Perform variant and reachability analysis of vulnerabilities statically with source code
- Determine if a given vulnerability is exploitable for your application and runtime context
- Implement a custom GNN using PyTorch or export the graph to Neo4j for large-scale lateral and longitudinal analysis
